# CallCounts
## Python to count numbers and types of call days from spreadsheet-style hospital call schedules 

Although commercial scheduling software exists, it is often pricey and not all hospitals/departments routinely use it. 
Without commercial scheduling software, we often end up creaiting (and emailing and re-eamiling) Excel-style schedule documents, listing who is covering what on which days. 

We all want to keep things fair, but counting those calls manually (or trying to get your spreadsheet program to do it) can be both tedious and error-prone. 

Shared here is a notebook that can take in .csv schedules of a style where the dates and days of the month are in one column, the services/calls to cover are in additonal columns, and the providers' names are in the cells corresponding to service/call type and date. 

Please feel free to take and adapt to your institution's needs.
